      <p>
        I am a human being who wants to be a silver lining for the world order
        and whose favorite quotation –also written in Michael Scofield’s
        gravestone- is: “be the change you want to see in the world”. Loving and
        caring children is one of my goals thus I volunteered in nongovernmental
        organizations to be with children who have chronic heart disease and
        children who are refugees.
